It is Feb 28, Friday. I had a Math 240 class in the morning. However, I was too tired to get up.

So I ended up not getting up and still lying on my bed.

It felt good actually. 


I kept lying on my bed until the sun went down. Then it went down again. And I never got up from my bed.

I lie in my bed to this day. I will never wake up. I slumber into the yawning mouth of eternity.
