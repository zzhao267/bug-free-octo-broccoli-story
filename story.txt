It is Feb 28, Friday. I had a Math 240 class in the morning. However, I was too tired to get up.

So I ended up not getting up and still lying on my bed.

It felt good actually. 


I kept lying on my bed until the sun went down. Then it went down again. And I never got up from my bed.

I lie in my bed to this day. I will never wake up. I slumber into the yawning mouth of eternity.

The day continues on, but my mind stays on the same moment for hours. I can't seem to keep my eyes open long enough to really observe what's around me. I'm in a constant state of unconsciousness.

Finally, I am into a higher level of life. I am a superman as Friedrich Nietzsche described.
